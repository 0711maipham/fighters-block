<h1>What is Fighter's Block?</h1>
Fighter's Block is a writing app that exploits <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning">conditioning</a> to overcome writer's block and sheer laziness. Rewards for writing and punishments for stopping are wrapped in a battle system inspired by turn-based RPGs.<p>The opponent is a monster that deals continuous damage to the you, while you must keep writing to heal yourself and attack the monster. Hurry, before your HP drops to zero!
<p>Worry about editing later. For now, just get those creative juices flowing, and write. 
<h1>Cool! How do I use it?</h1>
To get started, use the arrows to find a monster that matches your word count goal, and click the monster to continue.<br>

Use the slider to find your exact word count, or a close approximate.<br>

Now, defeat the monster by reaching your word count goal before your HP is reduced to zero.<br>

<h1>What do these buttons do?</h1>
<img src="4a.png"><br>
This is the Pause button. When the game is paused, the monster will no longer deal damage to you. It's a good option to use if watching the HP bar slide down is hurting your mojo.<p>
<img src="4b.png"><br>
This is the Player button. Here, you can find options to find a new monster, change your avatar*, or see your daily statistics*.<p>
<img src="4c.png"><br>
This is the Settings menu. Here, you can make cosmetic changes to the word editor itself, to make it something you're comfortable using.

Additionally, you can change the attack speed and strength of your monster, to better suit your writing process. A faster monster deals damage more quickly, while a stronger one deals more damage in one blow.<br>
<img src="4d.png"><br>
Finally, this is the Minimize key. This hides the pixel images and shrinks the HP bar, for distraction-free writing.<br>

<h1>Some final notes</h1>
The word count function works in English (and other languages that use spaces to separate words) as well as Chinese, because I write often in Chinese and figured it will make life easier.
